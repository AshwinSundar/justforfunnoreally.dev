    <h1>just for FUN, no REALLY</h1>
    <p>You may have been directed to this page because you or someone else asked one of the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Why are you doing this?"</li>
      <li>"What is the purpose of this project?"</li>
      <li>"What does this project do better than the existing stuff out there?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Silicon Valley Cutthroat</h2>
    <p>If one only spends time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, or other
    startup-oriented news sites, they might believe that everyone is working on their next
    multi-million-dollar startup and/or exit strategy. It may be hard to imagine that people work
    on open source purely for the fun of it.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong>&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;who just love
    <em class="highlight">the art of building software</em>. They do it for the challenge,
    for the fun of it. They aren't trying to make a million dollars.</p>

    <h2>Consumer Culture</h2>
    <p>Or, if one is used to <em class="highlighting">consuming</em> other projects only, and rarely
    creating one, they might get stuck in a mindset of thinking "what can this project do for me?"
    (And if the project isn't relevant to them, they wonder why it exists.)</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who don't care if you consume their project. Of course,
    they would love it if others enjoyed/admired/appreciated their work, but that's not strictly
    necessary. <em class="highlight">It's just fun to create.</em></p>

    <h2>We do it for the <em class="highlight">fun of it</em>. No, really.</h2>
